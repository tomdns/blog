Small experiment to have VATs to animate voxel simulations inside Unity, made in collaboration with [Pascal Beeckmans](https://www.behance.net/paqwak).
We exported a point cloud from Houdini (.abc file) that contains all the possible cells of the animation, like the bounding box of the whole simulation. Then a texture that contains for each frame of the animation the state of each voxel cell, and another one that contains the temperature or w/e data we want, so we can color the voxels in engine.

In Unity we used the Alembic package to import the point cloud. It already comes with a setup to draw any mesh instantiated on each point, using DrawMeshInstancedIndirect. Then in the shader we read the texture using the SV_InstanceID to collapse the vertices of the voxels according to their state at an instant t.
